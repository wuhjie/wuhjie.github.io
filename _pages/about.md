I am Hongjie Wu, a student in AI and Machine Learning, currently pursuing an MRes at Imperial College London. Prior to this, I completed an MSc in Machine Learning for Visual Data Analytics at Queen Mary University of London and a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Bristol. I am driven to combine my technical expertise with a passion for conducting impactful research.

I am seeking a Ph.D. position starting in Fall 2025. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to reach out.
